## Take-Home Task: Rick and Morty Android App with Kotlin

**Task Description:**
Your task is to design and implement a simple Android application that retrieves and displays information about the characters from the popular TV show "Rick and Morty". The application should fetch character data from the Rick and Morty API ([https://rickandmortyapi.com/](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)) and present it in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.

**Requirements:**
1. **The application should have at least two screens:**
   a) **Character List Screen:** Display a list of characters with their names and images. Tapping on a character should navigate to the Character Details Screen.
   b) **Character Details Screen:** Display detailed information about a selected character, including their name, image, status, species, gender, origin, and location.

2. **Fetching Data:**
   a) Use the API provided by the Rick and Morty API ([https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#get-all-characters](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#get-all-characters)) to retrieve character information.
   b) Implement network calls using a suitable networking library (e.g., Retrofit, Volley) or the built-in `HttpURLConnection` class.
   c) Handle data retrieval errors and display appropriate error messages or retry options to the user.

3. **UI/UX:**
   a) Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for both screens, considering factors like readability, aesthetics, and consistent design principles.
   b) Implement smooth transitions and animations to enhance the user experience.
   c) Use appropriate UI components (e.g., RecyclerView, ImageView) to display character data.

4. **Code Quality and Best Practices:**
   a) Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code using Kotlin.
   b) Implement proper error handling and validation.
   c) Follow architectural patterns like Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) or Model-View-Presenter (MVP) to separate concerns.
   d) Utilize appropriate libraries or frameworks to enhance code quality and development efficiency (e.g., LiveData, ViewModel, Glide).

5. **Bonus Points (Optional):**
   a) Implement a search functionality to filter characters by name or other attributes.
   b) Implement pagination to load characters in chunks instead of fetching all at once.
   c) Cache character data locally to support offline access.
   d) Implement unit tests for critical components or functionality.

**Submission Guidelines:**
1. Fork starter project (if any) or create a new project from scratch.
2. Organize the code in a clear and structured manner, following best practices.
3. Include a README file with instructions on how to build and run the application.
4. Submit your completed project as a ZIP file or provide a GitHub repository link (if applicable).

**Note:** The task is designed to assess your proficiency in Android development using Kotlin, as well as your ability to consume APIs, design user interfaces, and write clean code. Feel free to add your creativity and showcase additional skills beyond the specified requirements.

Good luck, and happy coding!
